      <description>In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve tried out some different web scraping techniques, experimenting with different Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.
While I was able to extract the data I was looking for from the specific webpages my code was crawling, the internet is a vast place and not all websites are created equal. When doing web scraping at scale, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to scrape sites that are protected by anti-bots like Distil, Akamai, or Cloudflare.</description>

      <description>Projects &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Web Scraping with Python

Following a Boston Python Project Night event that I attended (where my group focused on web scraping techniques), I wanted to try out some web scraping on my own with Python.
 Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites through an automated process.
 Dataset A good site for web scraping that was recommended to me at the event is College Sailing’s Techscore.</description>
