      <description>In March 2016 I joined Amazon Web Services for an all-day training event at the Westin Copley Place in Boston. The workshop provided a step-by-step introduction to the core AWS services for compute, storage, database and networking. AWS technical experts explained key features and use cases, shared best practices, and walked through technical demos. We specifically covered the following topics:
 Module 1: AWS Introduction and History Module 2: Infrastructure Services: Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC Module 3: Security, Identity, and Access Management: IAM Module 4: Databases: Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon RDS Module 5: AWS Elasticity and Management Tools: Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS Trusted Advisor  The day was a great for networking, learning more about cloud computing (from the clear market leader in this space) and how to get started on AWS Cloud.</description>
