      <description>In September 2021 I attended an excellent virtual conference, the Open Source Data Stack Conference. The conference profiled a number of platforms that can be combined together to form a modern open source data stack.
The emergence of the modern data stack has seen a rapid spike in the number of data tools an organization can use to drive better decision making. Each tool has become highly specialized in its portion of the data lifecycle, plus tools that are open source are a powerful way for technology buyers to reduce exposure to vendor lock-in.</description>

      <description>In May 2016 I attended my first Open Data Science Conference in Boston. There were some 3,000+ data science practioners that came together at the Boston Convention &amp;amp; Exhibition Center to share ideas about this rapidly changing discipline. The following topics were covered throughout the conference:
 Deep Learning Machine Learning Predictive Analytics Python Stan R Julia Hadoop Spark Scikit-learn Natural Language Processing  I attended sessions on popular data science statistical models and using Python for data science, where we worked through this example.</description>

      <description>In March 2016 I joined Amazon Web Services for an all-day training event at the Westin Copley Place in Boston. The workshop provided a step-by-step introduction to the core AWS services for compute, storage, database and networking. AWS technical experts explained key features and use cases, shared best practices, and walked through technical demos. We specifically covered the following topics:
 Module 1: AWS Introduction and History Module 2: Infrastructure Services: Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC Module 3: Security, Identity, and Access Management: IAM Module 4: Databases: Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon RDS Module 5: AWS Elasticity and Management Tools: Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS Trusted Advisor  The day was a great for networking, learning more about cloud computing (from the clear market leader in this space) and how to get started on AWS Cloud.</description>
