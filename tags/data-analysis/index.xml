Did you know that oceans absorb over 90% of the excess heat attributed to greenhouse gas emissions?
Oceans are the largest carbon sinks on the planet, and for many years, they have been absorbing man-made emissions like carbon dioxide and heat from the earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, mitigating the early effects of climate change on the planet. Without them, the world would have long since become barren and dead.</description>

The resurgence of SQL-based RDBMS If there is one analytics trend we can all agree on, it is that we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a vast increase in the amount of business data collected in the past decade. A typical business today uses dozens if not hundreds of cloud-based, subscription-as-a-service software, for all sorts of purposes.

      <description>For data engineers, the most important aspects of data storages are how they index, shard, and aggregate data.
 This post originally appeared on Toptal and was written by Ken Hu.
Data Engineering With the rise of big data and data science, many engineering roles are being challenged and expanded. One new-age role is data engineering.
Originally, the purpose of data engineering was the loading of external data sources and the designing of databases (designing and developing pipelines to collect, manipulate, store, and analyze data).</description>
