Today, there are 6,500 people on LinkedIn who call themselves data engineers according to stitchdata.com. In San Francisco alone, there are 6,600 job listings for this same title. The number of data engineers has doubled in the past year, but engineering leaders still find themselves faced with a significant shortage of data engineering talent. So is it really the future of data warehousing?</description>

Batch data processing — historically known as ETL — is extremely challenging. It&amp;rsquo;s time-consuming, brittle, and often unrewarding. Not only that, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to operate, evolve, and troubleshoot.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how applying the functional programming paradigm to data engineering can bring a lot of clarity to the process. This post distills fragments of wisdom accumulated while working at Yahoo, Facebook, Airbnb and Lyft, with the perspective of well over a decade of data warehousing and data engineering experience.</description>
