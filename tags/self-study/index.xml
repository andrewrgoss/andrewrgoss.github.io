      <title>My Path to Learning Scala</title>

      <description>I recently joined a new data engineering team at DigitasLBi and Scala is the predominant language being used. Having never coded in this language, I sought to quickly learn it and wanted to share the numerous resources I came across and bookmarked.
The first place I usually turn when learning something new is to complete an introductory online course with videos and exercises. The most popular course for Scala is Functional Programming Principles in Scala on Coursera and it is taught by the inventor of the language (Martin Odersky), so I gave it a whirl.</description>

      <description>Udemy- Complete JavaScript Course &amp;gt;&amp;gt; My projects

Part of the Complete JavaScript Course I completed, this project put JavaScript concepts from the section on DOM manipulation and events into practice.
GAME RULES:  The game has 2 players, playing in rounds In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his/her ROUND score gets lost.</description>

      <description>COMPLETION CERTIFICATE
Design and Coding Resources

This course represented my official foray into learning JavaScript. Up to this point I&amp;rsquo;d only used it on occasion with no formal training, as my focus has been predominantly on back-end data engineering. I wanted to gain a closer perspective on full-stack development, and JavaScript is a core front-end technology for me to have as part of my stack. This course covers the following areas:</description>

Lesson Transcripts/Labs  My goal in taking this course was to expand upon my knowledge around Apache Hadoop, a free, open source, Java-based programming framework. Topics in this course include:
 Hadoop&amp;rsquo;s architecture and core components, such as MapReduce and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Adding/removing nodes from Hadoop clusters, how to check available disk space on each node, and how to modify configuration parameters.</description>

Jupyter Notebooks
 I took this course to get some experience using Jupyter Notebooks and furthered my Python skills in a couple of areas:
 Algorithm Analysis and Big-O Notation Array Sequences  Additionally, this course offers video content on the &amp;lsquo;soft skills&amp;rsquo; needed to advance a career in technology such as personal branding, building a strong professional network, and practicing technical questions that could be asked on a future interview.</description>

      <description>COMPLETION CERTIFICATE  I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Python more for work and took this course to strengthen my knowledge around the fundamentals of the language. Previously, I had been wanting to add Python to my personal tech stack for some time as it is a powerful (and popular) all-purpose programming language. It is a high-level language, meaning it looks more like a readable, human language than a low-level language does. The user-friendly syntax makes it one of the easier languages to learn and it is also one of the most commonly-used languages for analytics, data mining, and data science.</description>

      <description>BOOK LINK  Go (Golang) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. I first started using Go through my work at DigitasLBi. My department adopted this language as one of our tech stacks for the following reasons:
 It’s open source (i.e. free) and intended to be simple yet expressive. It’s intended to be a good middleware layer to provide for both quick one-off applications as well as large collaborative code bases.</description>

      <description>COMPLETION CERTIFICATE  I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on Windows servers throughout my career, which initially got me started with this language. Learning some of the Base Class Library (BCL) of the Microsoft .NET Framework and using these classes through C# has helped me automate various tasks within these environments.
My goal in taking this course was to strengthen my knowledge around the fundamentals of C# programming (and objected-oriented programming in general) and to get more practice.</description>

      <description>Projects &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Scratch - Wind Power
 As part of the popular Harvard University course CS50x that I took through EdX, I built a small Scratch application in completing the first problem set.
 Scratch is a &amp;lsquo;language&amp;rsquo; wherein you create programs by dragging together and connecting “blocks”. Unlike other programming languages, Scratch is very visual, making it a good first project for building fundamentals and learning to think like a programmer.</description>
