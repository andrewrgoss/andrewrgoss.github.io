Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is becoming increasingly important for data science teams. CI/CD is a set of practices and processes that allow software developers to quickly and efficiently develop, test, deploy, monitor, and maintain their applications.
When applied to data science projects, it can help streamline the development process by automating tests and deployments, integrating machine learning models into production systems, managing your codebase across different environments, and more.</description>

The most fundamental part of any automated software engineering project is a CI/CD pipeline. The utilization of automation to guarantee code quality is an important component of the CI/CD workflow. Test automation is used to deploy code changes to various environments, deliver applications to production systems, and uncover vulnerabilities and other concerns early on as the software changes move through the pipeline. The automation&amp;rsquo;s task in this situation is to conduct quality checks, evaluating factors like performance, API usage, and security.</description>

      <title>DataOps is NOT Just DevOps for Data</title>

One common misconception about DataOps is that it is just DevOps applied to data analytics. While a little semantically misleading, the name “DataOps” has one positive attribute. It communicates that data analytics can achieve what software development attained with DevOps. That is to say, DataOps can yield an order of magnitude improvement in quality and cycle time when data teams utilize new tools and methodologies. The specific ways that DataOps achieves these gains reflect the unique people, processes and tools characteristic of data teams (versus software development teams using DevOps).</description>

The resurgence of SQL-based RDBMS If there is one analytics trend we can all agree on, it is that we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a vast increase in the amount of business data collected in the past decade. A typical business today uses dozens if not hundreds of cloud-based, subscription-as-a-service software, for all sorts of purposes. Together with more traditional in-house enterprise software, the average business produces a mountain of data today, compared to just a few years ago.</description>

What Is DataOps? DataOps is a discipline that has become a necessity in a market where the demand for access to data assets and data products is skyrocketing. The inability of data platform teams and data management platforms to keep pace with the demands placed on them by DevOps-enabled teams led to the development of DataOps.[i]
In a nutshell, DataOps brings together data scientists, analysts, developers, and operations to work on the entire product/service lifecycle, from the design stage to production support.</description>

      <description>Large enterprises are experiencing a foundational shift in how they view their data and structure their data engineering teams. As organizations capture more data than ever before, and store it in an ever-increasing variety of data stores, the prospect of competing on analytics becomes more tantalizing than ever.
