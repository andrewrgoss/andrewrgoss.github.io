      <description>In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve tried out some different web scraping techniques, experimenting with different Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.
While I was able to extract the data I was looking for from the specific webpages my code was crawling, the internet is a vast place and not all websites are created equal. When doing web scraping at scale, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to scrape sites that are protected by anti-bots like Distil, Akamai, or Cloudflare.</description>

      <description>written by DataKitchen 
One common misconception about DataOps is that it is just DevOps applied to data analytics. While a little semantically misleading, the name “DataOps” has one positive attribute. It communicates that data analytics can achieve what software development attained with DevOps. That is to say, DataOps can yield an order of magnitude improvement in quality and cycle time when data teams utilize new tools and methodologies. The specific ways that DataOps achieves these gains reflect the unique people, processes and tools characteristic of data teams (versus software development teams using DevOps).</description>

Building Snowpipe on Azure Blob Storage Using Azure Portal Web UI for Snowflake Data Warehouse
Snowpipe was introduced to be utilized for automatically discovering new data files in cloud storage (e.g. Azure Blob Storage) and then load the data into a certain table.
Snowpipe is a very convenient tool for the above purposes. However, Snowpipe itself is only considered as the “E” (Extract) of ELT, because only COPY INTO command is allowed in a Snowpipe creating statement.</description>

The resurgence of SQL-based RDBMS If there is one analytics trend we can all agree on, it is that we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a vast increase in the amount of business data collected in the past decade. A typical business today uses dozens if not hundreds of cloud-based, subscription-as-a-service software, for all sorts of purposes. Together with more traditional in-house enterprise software, the average business produces a mountain of data today, compared to just a few years ago.</description>

What Is DataOps? DataOps is a discipline that has become a necessity in a market where the demand for access to data assets and data products is skyrocketing. The inability of data platform teams and data management platforms to keep pace with the demands placed on them by DevOps-enabled teams led to the development of DataOps.[i]
In a nutshell, DataOps brings together data scientists, analysts, developers, and operations to work on the entire product/service lifecycle, from the design stage to production support.</description>

Introduction Most applications today have the need to fetch data from a server where that data is stored in a database. It’s the responsibility of the API to provide an interface to the stored data that fits an application’s needs.
 APIs have become ubiquitous components of software infrastructures. In short, an API defines how a client can load data from a server.</description>

A data engineer specializes in several specific technical aspects. Data engineers have solid automation/programming skills, ETL design, understand systems, data modeling, SQL, and usually some other more niche skills. For instance, some data engineers start to dabble with R and data analytics. This will also be driven by their specific role. As a data engineer, I have been asked to set up basic websites, develop APIs and create models and algorithms.</description>

Batch data processing — historically known as ETL — is extremely challenging. It&amp;rsquo;s time-consuming, brittle, and often unrewarding. Not only that, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to operate, evolve, and troubleshoot.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how applying the functional programming paradigm to data engineering can bring a lot of clarity to the process. This post distills fragments of wisdom accumulated while working at Yahoo, Facebook, Airbnb and Lyft, with the perspective of well over a decade of data warehousing and data engineering experience.</description>

      <description>The two positions are not interchangeable—and misperceptions of their roles can hurt teams and compromise productivity.
 written by Jesse Anderson
View original article

It’s important to understand the differences between a data engineer and a data scientist. Misunderstanding or not knowing these differences are making teams fail or underperform with big data.
A key misunderstanding is the strengths and weaknesses of each position. I think some of these misconceptions come from the diagrams that are used to describe data scientists and data engineers.</description>

As organizations capture more data than ever before, and store it in an ever-increasing variety of data stores, the prospect of competing on analytics becomes more tantalizing than ever.

The challenges of using data at scale, however, is rooted in the &amp;ldquo;data debt&amp;rdquo; accumulated over time by enterprises struggling to manage the extreme volume and variety of their data.</description>

The shortage of data scientists - those triple-threat types who possess advanced statistics, business, and coding skills - has been well-documented over the years. But increasingly, businesses are facing a shortage of another key individual on the big data team who&amp;rsquo;s critical to achieving success - the data engineer.
 Data engineers are tasked with building and maintaining the pipes that serve up fresh and accurate data.</description>

      <description>As 2018 began, I spent some time thinking about my goals for this year. An area that I wanted to focus on is improving upon how I learn. Many have argued that the ability to learn is the most valuable skill you can possess throughout your career and working in the ever-changing field of technology, I certainly would not disagree.
So I decided to invest in the 10 Steps to Learn Anything Quickly course offered by Simple Programmer.</description>

Do you ever feel like you are confident in only one particular field? Like you know only one tiny corner of the vast software universe? Then, the minute you try to escape it and work on something different, you get frustrated. And if you need to build a complete, functional project—from scratch—with:
Initial research and machine setup (packages, installments)Managing dependencies (libraries, build tools, automations)The whole business logic plus high test coverageProduction deployment … then somebody else has to do everything except the little corner of your comfort zone?</description>

      <description>I recently joined a new data engineering team at DigitasLBi and Scala is the predominant language being used. Having never coded in this language, I sought to quickly learn it and wanted to share the numerous resources I came across and bookmarked.
The first place I usually turn when learning something new is to complete an introductory online course with videos and exercises. The most popular course for Scala is Functional Programming Principles in Scala on Coursera and it is taught by the inventor of the language (Martin Odersky), so I gave it a whirl.</description>

 Merging the gaps between data science and engineering, and what each side can learn from the other.
 In my experience working with data engineering teams, I find that most teams don’t realize they have to change their thinking about data and systems to be successful with big data. Data engineering teams need to think about how data is valuable and at what scale the data is coming in.</description>

I joined Facebook in 2011 as a business intelligence engineer. By the time I left in 2013, I was a data engineer.
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t promoted or assigned to this new role. Instead, Facebook came to realize that the work we were doing transcended classic business intelligence. The role we&amp;rsquo;d created for ourselves was a new discipline entirely.
My team was at forefront of this transformation. We were developing new skills, new ways of doing things, new tools, and&amp;ndash;more often than not&amp;ndash;turning our backs to traditional methods.</description>

When it comes to the medical profession, doctors get all the glory. In the world of IoT, it&amp;rsquo;s data scientists who get most of the attention and acclaim. They extract critical intelligence from big data so businesses can make informed decisions on the spot. But they don&amp;rsquo;t do their work in a vacuum. Data scientists can&amp;rsquo;t dazzle their industries without data engineers. These unheralded champions, equivalent to nurses, ensure that big data keeps flowing.</description>

Like data scientists, data engineers write code. They’re highly analytical, and are interested in data visualization. Unlike data scientists — and inspired by a more mature parent, software engineering — data engineers build tools, infrastructure, frameworks, and services.</description>

Today, there are 6,500 people on LinkedIn who call themselves data engineers. In San Francisco alone, there are 6,600 job listings for this same title. The number of data engineers has doubled in the past year, but engineering leaders still find themselves faced with a significant shortage of data engineering talent.
The need for data talent is born from a fundamental shift: tech companies are now data companies.</description>

Previously, I had been wanting to add Python to my personal tech stack for some time as it is a powerful (and popular) all-purpose programming language. It is a high-level language, meaning it looks more like a readable, human language than a low-level language does. The user-friendly syntax makes it one of the easier languages to learn and it is also one of the most commonly-used languages for analytics, data mining, and data science.</description>

      <description>In March 2016 I joined Amazon Web Services for an all-day training event at the Westin Copley Place in Boston. The workshop provided a step-by-step introduction to the core AWS services for compute, storage, database and networking. AWS technical experts explained key features and use cases, shared best practices, and walked through technical demos. We specifically covered the following topics:
 Module 1: AWS Introduction and History Module 2: Infrastructure Services: Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC Module 3: Security, Identity, and Access Management: IAM Module 4: Databases: Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon RDS Module 5: AWS Elasticity and Management Tools: Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS Trusted Advisor  The day was a great for networking, learning more about cloud computing (from the clear market leader in this space) and how to get started on AWS Cloud.</description>

      <description>BOOK LINK  Go (Golang) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. I first started using Go through my work at DigitasLBi. My department adopted this language as one of our tech stacks for the following reasons:
 It’s open source (i.e. free) and intended to be simple yet expressive. It’s intended to be a good middleware layer to provide for both quick one-off applications as well as large collaborative code bases.</description>

      <description>COMPLETION CERTIFICATE  I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on Windows servers throughout my career, which initially got me started with this language. Learning some of the Base Class Library (BCL) of the Microsoft .NET Framework and using these classes through C# has helped me automate various tasks within these environments.
My goal in taking this course was to strengthen my knowledge around the fundamentals of C# programming (and objected-oriented programming in general) and to get more practice.</description>

      <description>For a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve believed in the importance of having a blog but have struggled to keep one going. I started out using Blogger back in the day and most recently was using Wordpress. But there were features about these blogging platforms that consistently bugged me. Fortunately for me, while I was learning the Go programming language I stumbled across Hugo, a static site generator written in this language.</description>
