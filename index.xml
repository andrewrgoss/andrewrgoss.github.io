      <description>Udemy- Complete JavaScript Course &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Advanced JavaScript: Objections and Functions 
Summary  Every JavaScript object has a prototype property, which makes inheritance possible in JavaScript; The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit; The Constructor&amp;rsquo;s prototype property is NOT the prototype of the Constructor itself; it&amp;rsquo;s the prototype of ALL instances that are created through it; When a certain method (or property) is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found, the search moves on to the object&amp;rsquo;s prototype.</description>

      <description>Udemy- Complete JavaScript Course &amp;gt;&amp;gt; JavaScript language basics 
Introduction to JavaScript What is JavaScript?  JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented computer programming language. JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of web development. JavaScript is most commonly used as part of webpages. Today, JavaScript can be used in different places:  Client-side: JavaScript was traditionally only used in the browser Server-side: Thanks to node.js, we can use JavaScript on the server as well  JavaScript is what made modern web development possible:  Dynamic effects and interactivity; Modern web applications that we can interact with.</description>

Design and Coding Resources

This course represented my official foray into learning JavaScript. Up to this point I&amp;rsquo;d only used it on occasion with no formal training, as my focus has been predominantly on back-end data engineering. I wanted to gain a closer perspective on full-stack development, and JavaScript is a core front-end technology for me to have as part of my stack. This course covers the following areas:</description>

 InfoWorld examines the strengths, weaknesses, use cases, and future directions of Google&amp;rsquo;s hit programming language
 During its eight-plus years in the wild, Google’s Go language—with version 1.8.1 out as of April 2017—has evolved from being a curiosity for alpha geeks to being the battle-tested programming language behind some of the world’s most important cloud-centric projects.
Why was Go chosen by the developers of such projects as Docker and Kubernetes?</description>

 Merging the gaps between data science and engineering, and what each side can learn from the other.
 In my experience working with data engineering teams, I find that most teams don’t realize they have to change their thinking about data and systems to be successful with big data. Data engineering teams need to think about how data is valuable and at what scale the data is coming in.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been recently working on software application project at DigitasLBi where we adopted NSQ as part of our microservices architecture. With this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to share how you can get started with NSQ by sending and receiving a simple message by writing some Go code.
What is NSQ? Per the official website, NSQ is a realtime distributed messaging platform designed to operate at scale, handling billions of messages per day.</description>

      <description>written by Maxime Beauchemin
I joined Facebook in 2011 as a business intelligence engineer. By the time I left in 2013, I was a data engineer.
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t promoted or assigned to this new role. Instead, Facebook came to realize that the work we were doing transcended classic business intelligence. The role we&amp;rsquo;d created for ourselves was a new discipline entirely.
My team was at forefront of this transformation. We were developing new skills, new ways of doing things, new tools, and&amp;ndash;more often than not&amp;ndash;turning our backs to traditional methods.</description>

 Welcome to HDFS command line interface. In this presentation, I will cover the general usage of the HDFS command line interface and commands specific to HDFS. Other commands should be familiar to anyone with UNIX experience and will not be covered.
The HDFS can be manipulated through a Java API or through a command line interface. All commands for manipulating HDFS through Hadoop&amp;rsquo;s command line interface begin with hdfs, a space, and dfs.</description>

 Welcome to the unit of Hadoop Fundamentals on Hadoop architecture. I will begin with a terminology review and then cover the major components of Hadoop. We will see what types of nodes can exist in a Hadoop cluster and talk about how Hadoop uses replication to lessen data loss. Finally I will explain an important feature of Hadoop called &amp;ldquo;rack awareness&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;network topology awareness&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Big Data University- Hadoop 101 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Lesson Transcripts/Labs &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Unit_2_Hadoop_Architecture_Part2 
 Hadoop 2.2 brought about architectural changes to MapReduce. As Hadoop has matured, people have found that it can be used for more than running MapReduce jobs. But to keep each new framework from having its own resource manager and scheduler, that would compete with the other framework resource managers and schedulers, it was decided to have the recourse manager and schedulers to be external to any framework.</description>

      <description>Big Data University- Hadoop 101 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Lesson Transcripts/Labs &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Unit_3_Hadoop_Administration 
 Welcome to the unit on Hadoop Administration. The agenda covers adding nodes to a cluster, verifying the health of a cluster, and stopping / starting components. Then the unit covers configuring Hadoop and setting up rack topology. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with adding and removing nodes from a cluster.
Adding nodes can be performed from the Ambari Console. To do so requires either the ip address or hostname of the node to be added.</description>

      <description>Big Data University- Hadoop 101 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Lesson Transcripts/Labs &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Unit_4_Flume_Sqoop_Oozie 
 Now let us look at moving data into Hadoop. We will begin by looking at Flume&amp;rsquo;s architecture, then examining the three modes it can run in followed by a look at the event data model. Flume is an open source software program developed by Cloudera that acts as a service for aggregating and moving large amounts of data around a Hadoop cluster as the data is produced or shortly thereafter.</description>

 Welcome to Hadoop Fundamentals, Hadoop Components. In this unit I will discuss the MapReduce Philosophy, describe the usage of Pig and Hive, talk about how to get data into Hadoop through the use of Flume and Sqoop and finally describe how to schedule and control job execution using Oozie.
First I need to set the boundaries for this unit.</description>

      <description>Big Data University- Hadoop 101 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Lesson Transcripts/Labs &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Unit_4_Pig_Hive 
 Pig and Hive have much in common. They all translate high-level languages into MapReduce jobs so that the programmer can work at a higher level than he or she would when writing MapReduce jobs in Java or other lower-level languages supported by Hadoop using Hadoop streaming. The high level languages offered by Pig and Hive let you write programs that are much smaller than the equivalent Java code.</description>

      <description>written by Neeraj Chadha
When it comes to the medical profession, doctors get all the glory. In the world of IoT, it&amp;rsquo;s data scientists who get most of the attention and acclaim. They extract critical intelligence from big data so businesses can make informed decisions on the spot. But they don&amp;rsquo;t do their work in a vacuum. Data scientists can&amp;rsquo;t dazzle their industries without data engineers. These unheralded champions, equivalent to nurses, ensure that big data keeps flowing.</description>

      <description>Across industries, the applied use of data to inform business decisions has become a foundational (arguably critical) element of business. The end goal is to ultimately derive actionable insights from vast amounts of data being collected but it takes a series of activities/tasks to arrive at this juncture. Here is a description of each stage of the analytics life cycle:
 Data Acquisition – This may involve scraping data, interfacing with APIs, querying relational and non-relational databases, or defining strategy in relation to what data to pursue.</description>

      <description>Data engineer and data scientist are the two most popular career tracks in big data - but how do they compare? At a high level, data engineers are concerned with data infrastructure, while data scientists are concerned with analysis.
Like data scientists, data engineers write code. They’re highly analytical, and are interested in data visualization. Unlike data scientists — and inspired by a more mature parent, software engineering — data engineers build tools, infrastructure, frameworks, and services.</description>

      <description>I recently came across an excellent report by Stitch on the state of data engineering.
Today, there are 6,500 people on LinkedIn who call themselves data engineers. In San Francisco alone, there are 6,600 job listings for this same title. The number of data engineers has doubled in the past year, but engineering leaders still find themselves faced with a significant shortage of data engineering talent.
The need for data talent is born from a fundamental shift: tech companies are now data companies.</description>

      <description>In my work at DigitasLBi, I need to login to a number of client-specific Linux machines via a terminal emulator (there is no UI for these remote environments) from my local Windows laptop. For this my team uses Cygwin, a Linux-like environment for Windows making it possible to port software running on POSIX systems (such as Linux, BSD, and Unix systems) to Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to login of course just using a standard username/password combination with Mosh or SSH at the command line.</description>

      <description>COMPLETION CERTIFICATE  I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Python more for work and took this course to strengthen my knowledge around the fundamentals of the language. Previously, I had been wanting to add Python to my personal tech stack for some time as it is a powerful (and popular) all-purpose programming language. It is a high-level language, meaning it looks more like a readable, human language than a low-level language does. The user-friendly syntax makes it one of the easier languages to learn and it is also one of the most commonly-used languages for analytics, data mining, and data science.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever written code of any kind for professional and personal purposes, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely come across the concept of Source Control Management (SCM). When I first became a developer, I used Subversion as my SCM tool but have since switched to the more popular Git. I use git to commit the latest versions of code in both Linux and Windows environments, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on Windows in this post as this is the operating system for my personal computer.</description>

      <description>In March 2016 I joined Amazon Web Services for an all-day training event at the Westin Copley Place in Boston. The workshop provided a step-by-step introduction to the core AWS services for compute, storage, database and networking. AWS technical experts explained key features and use cases, shared best practices, and walked through technical demos. We specifically covered the following topics:
 Module 1: AWS Introduction and History Module 2: Infrastructure Services: Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC Module 3: Security, Identity, and Access Management: IAM Module 4: Databases: Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon RDS Module 5: AWS Elasticity and Management Tools: Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS Trusted Advisor  The day was a great for networking, learning more about cloud computing (from the clear market leader in this space) and how to get started on AWS Cloud.</description>

      <description>BOOK LINK  Go (Golang) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. I first started using Go through my work at DigitasLBi. My department adopted this language as one of our tech stacks for the following reasons:
 It’s open source (i.e. free) and intended to be simple yet expressive. It’s intended to be a good middleware layer to provide for both quick one-off applications as well as large collaborative code bases.</description>

      <description>Projects &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Scratch - Wind Power
 As part of the popular Harvard University course CS50x that I took through EdX, I built a small Scratch application in completing the first problem set.
 Scratch is a &amp;lsquo;language&amp;rsquo; wherein you create programs by dragging together and connecting “blocks”. Unlike other programming languages, Scratch is very visual, making it a good first project for building fundamentals and learning to think like a programmer.</description>
